# Django-Blog 
1. This project is a basic blog website using Django. In this project, a user can create an account or login, search for a specific post, create a post, update a post, or delete a post. A user must be authenticated properly in order to access certain pages such as the profile page. Only users who created a specific post are allowed to edit/delete them. A user can also freely filter the home page based on a posts title.
