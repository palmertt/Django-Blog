## What is this project? 
1. This project is a basic blog website using Django. In this project, a user can create an account or login, search for a specific post, create a post, update a post, or delete a post. A user must be authenticated properly in order to access certain pages such as the profile page. Only users who created a specific post are allowed to edit/delete them. A user can also freely filter the home page based on a posts title.

## What would I change doing it again? (I will add this changes in a later date)
1. The number one thing I would change is the fact that the search bar doesn't work on every page, only on the home page. I would also change the way that the pagination menu bar looks. Lastly, I should have added the ability for posts to displayed on the author's profile page.

## Technologies Used
1. Django & pip packages
2. HTML & CSS
3. Bootstrap
